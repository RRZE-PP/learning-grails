## 0. About this document

This document is meant to be a guide to "jump-start" learning the web-framework [Grails](http://www.grails.org/) for our future employees and all who are interested. It is our intention to guide a path for self studies. Please walk this way ...


## 1. Learning Grails

As we want to foster a "jump-start" we start right away:

1. [Install GGTS](https://spring.io/tools/ggts/all)
   * GGTS _- the Groovy/Grails Tool Suite™ -_ is an [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)-based IDE
   * (Not so short) video [tutorial/introduction](https://youtu.be/cIjInOkUDy8) into GGTS
1. [Work through this tutorial](http://www.grailsexample.net/course-outline/)
   * There is an accompanying video series on [youtube](https://youtu.be/qcZ6FWmIuJc?list=PLMIXRBXuv8yaPUYMwlDRvUNf44LgCUunY) for this.
   * In case you need more information on the installation on your prefered plattform, please look up the [Documentation](http://www.grails.org/single-page-documentation.html).
1. [SpringSource](https://www.youtube.com/user/SpringSourceDev/) has some valuable video turotials (not only) about Grails on youtube.
   1. [Getting Started with Grails - Part 1](https://youtu.be/PXHxo43hn34)
   1. [Getting Started with Grails - Part 2](https://youtu.be/qNFksvLxZNU)
   1. [Getting Started with Grails - Part 3 ](https://youtu.be/oL4yVtNU31E)
 1. Next you can follow Ben Davis on a more practical approach and build a link shortener
    1. [Part 1](http://www.learningtechnicalstuff.com/2012/04/building-url-shortener-in-grails-pt-1.html)
    1. [Part 2](http://www.learningtechnicalstuff.com/2012/05/building-url-shortener-in-grails-pt-2.html)
1. Depending on what you are most interested in, consider to do some tutorials from the [Grails Tutorial for Beginners - Grails Cookbook](http://grails.asia/grails-tutorial-for-beginners)

... for all additional questions, please refer to the (very good) [Grails Documentation](http://www.grails.org/single-page-documentation.html).

### 1.1 Grails Books

The following books are recommended as reference and should be available in most libraries or even online via your library/organisation:

* Burt Beckwith: [Programming Grails](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/9781449324513), O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2013.

### 1.2 Grails Additional Links

You search for more information? So please start from one of these:

* In case of questions/problems look on [Stack Overflow tag:grails](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/grails), as the probability is high that someone else had the same problem and got a suggestion for a solution there.
* More video tutorials from SpringSource on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/SpringSourceDev/search?query=grails).
* IBM has publishes a [series of Grails tutorials](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/libraryview.jsp?search_by=mastering+grails) covering different aspects.
* Have look every once and a while on [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg) Grails](https://github.com/hitenpratap/awesome-grails), where helpful links are collected.

## 2. Groovy

As Grails is based on [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/) is is maybe a good idea to have a closer look into Groovy as well. :wink:

1. [Install](http://www.groovy-lang.org/install.html) is always a good idea.
1. Work through [The Groovy 2 Tutorial](https://leanpub.com/groovytutorial/read).
   * _Plese consider buying the book!_
   * The website [The Groovy Tutorial](http://www.groovy-tutorial.org/) accompanies the book and has some code.

... for all additional questions, please refer to the (very good) [Groovy Documentation](http://www.groovy-lang.org/single-page-documentation.html).
